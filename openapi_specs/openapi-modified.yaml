# Modified version of the OpenAPI specification for the Mistral AI API
# The original file is `openapi_specs/openapi-original.yaml`
# Version: 1 (bump the number if there are no changes in the original file but we still need to publish new release)
#
# Modifications:
# - Adjusted the OpenAPI version to 3.0.3 (port from 3.1.0)
# - Fixes errors found in 3.1.0 spec (wrong use of $ref or wrong required fields)
# - Each place where we differ from original has comment explaining change
#
# Guidelines (differences that were applied so far):
# - keep this file as close to `openapi_specs/openapi-original.yaml` as possible
# - always mark difference between original and this file with comment
# - 'null' is not allowed in OpenAPI 3.0.3, use 'nullable: true' instead
# - `examples` should become `example` in 3.0.3
# - 'operationId' naming changes for better generated code
# - 'const' is not allowed in OpenAPI 3.0.3, use 'enum' instead (optionally with default value)
# - 'allOf' requires closer look, sometimes it's better to use 'oneOf' or 'anyOf' instead
# - 'discriminator' is not supported by our generator (just port it as it is)
# - use lint to check for errors in the spec like https://editor.swagger.io/ or https://quobix.com/vacuum/
# - some documentation changes where not applied for better readability
# - 'type' property added sometimes for better code generation

          description: frequency_penalty penalizes the repetition of words based on their frequency in the generated text. A higher frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating words that have already appeared frequently in the output, promoting diversity and reducing repetition.
